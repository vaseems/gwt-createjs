	 * <b>This is an experimental method, and may be buggy. Please report issues.</b><br/><br/>
	 * Extends the existing sprite sheet by flipping the original frames horizontally, vertically, or both,
	 * and adding appropriate animation & frame data. The flipped animations will have a suffix added to their names
	 * (_h, _v, _hv as appropriate). Make sure the sprite sheet images are fully loaded before using this method.
	 * <br/><br/>
	 * For example:<br/>
	 * SpriteSheetUtils.addFlippedFrames(mySpriteSheet, true, true);
	 * The above would add frames that are flipped horizontally AND frames that are flipped vertically.
	 * <br/><br/>
	 * Note that you can also flip any display object by setting its scaleX or scaleY to a negative value. On some
	 * browsers (especially those without hardware accelerated canvas) this can result in slightly degraded performance,
	 * which is why addFlippedFrames is available.
	 * @method addFlippedFrames
	 * @static
	 * @param {SpriteSheet} spriteSheet
	 * @param {Boolean} horizontal If true, horizontally flipped frames will be added.
	 * @param {Boolean} vertical If true, vertically flipped frames will be added.
	 * @param {Boolean} both If true, frames that are flipped both horizontally and vertically will be added.
	 * @deprecated Modern browsers perform better when flipping via a transform (ex. scaleX=-1) rendering this obsolete.
